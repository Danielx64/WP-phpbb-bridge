In order to reset the settings you will need to log into something like phpmyadmin or what ever database management system that your webhost has installed.

After you logged into your database management system, you will need to first select the database that has your wp_options table. 

After that you will need to look for a row that has theme_propress_options in it. Once you done that, you can just click on the delete button and click on yes or ok.

Now the settings should be back to the default settings.
